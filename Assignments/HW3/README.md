## Brain Tumor Diagnosis (DL_Q4.ipynb)
In this task, we want to binary-classify the images of brain whether they contain tumor or not.  
This is done using a CNN and an Early Stopping strategy, reaching 96 percent accuracy on validation data. 

## CIFAR10 Classification using an Inception module (DL_Q7.ipynb)
I have concatenated 3 towers of CNN in my Inception module. Accuracy on validation data is 57 percents.
