## MNIST classification using KerasTuner (KerasTuner.ipynb)
- KerasTuner is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.  
- I used KerasTuner For the number of convolutional layers, number of filters, number of fully connected layers, number of neurons, learning rate, and Dropout probability  
- KerasTuner comes in different models like HyperBand, RandomSearch, and Bayesian Optimization which differ in the search algorithm. Here I used the HyperBand model.



## Wrist Fracture Classification (medical.ipynb)
I used transfer learning using pre-trained networks on ImageNet  
Two experiments were done:
- Using VGG16 as backbone
- Using ResNet50 as backbone
