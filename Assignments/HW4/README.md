## MNIST classification using KerasTuner (KerasTuner.ipynb)
- KerasTuner is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.  
- I used KerasTuner For the number of convolutional layers, number of filters, number of fully connected layers, number of neurons, learning rate, and Dropout probability  
- KerasTuner comes in different models like HyperBand, RandomSearch, and Bayesian Optimization. Here I used the HyperBand model.
